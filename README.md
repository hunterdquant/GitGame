# GitGame
This game is a project for CS350 at Clarkson University. This is an attempt at making learning proper version control practice fun!

This game is the brain child of Hunter Quant and Matthew Coupal.
  - The idea is to have a game that is generated by revision history and rewards players for good practice.
