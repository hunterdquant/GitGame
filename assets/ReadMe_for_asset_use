Here are some of my initial assets:

-the six "tilesAnim" images are different frames of animation for the world tiles. They should be
animated in order from 1-6, and then backwards from 5 all the way to 1. Thereafter, they should smoothly loop.

-there is an unanimated placeholder to represent the player charatcer. I'll make it better later.

-The current tilesAnim set of images has floor, wall, wallcorner, doorway, and end-of-level tiles. The red doorway
is not yet animated. Wall and door tiles will HAVE to be rotated, and floor tiles should probably be roated as they're
placed for more visual variation. (The six unique floor tiles would become 24 unique floor tiles.)

-I'm aware that the end-of-level tile's animation is still a little poor. I'll work to smooth it up later.

-The doorway portal will probably also be improved later, to make it look a little smoother and less ms-paint esque.

-If you want these on individual sprite sheets instead, tell me and I can do it no problem.
